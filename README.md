LEDs
====

An Arduino sketch for controlling individually addressable LED strips using the popular
[FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) library. The code for displaying various
patterns has been abstracted out into a class named `Patterns` with some built in patterns
ready to choose from. The idea for this came from the Adafruit `NeoPatterns` class, as decribed in
